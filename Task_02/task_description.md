# Task 2

This task is useful for DevOps and contains skills relevant to every IT professional.

## Task Description

- Language: You can choose either JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C#, Python, Ruby, or any language of your choice.

- Download the archive containing binary files from [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oy2668zp1lsuseh/task2.zip?dl=1).

- Calculate the SHA3-256 hash for each file in the archive. Note that the files are binary, so you should not perform any encodings. If you read a file as a string using encoding, ensure that you use the same encoding to decode the string back into bytes for hashing. Avoid unnecessary conversions.

- Write the hashes as 64 lowercase hexadecimal digits.

- Sort the hashes in ascending order, treating them as strings (not as individual characters within the hashes).

- Concatenate the sorted hashes into a single string without using any separators.

- Append your email address (in lowercase) to the end of the concatenated string.

- Calculate the SHA3-256 hash of the resulting string.

- Send the obtained 64 lowercase hexadecimal digits to ilearning.task2@gmail.com (use this email address only for Task #2).

Please note that SHA3-256 is not the same algorithm as SHA-256.
